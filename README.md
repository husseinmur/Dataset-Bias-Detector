# Dataset-Bias-Detector
Current ML systems have implicit biases towards minorities. These Biases are originated by imbalanced datasets.

In this project, I trained three models that can predict age, gender, and race. 

Then a report is generated for their percentages in the dataset, showing the machine learning engineer all the imbalances.
